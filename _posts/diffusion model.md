It is said that the best way to learn something is to do it and explain it to others in my own language.

One thing that I learned from the author of diffusion policy is that the it can handle data with multi modality.

Then I have a question about what is multi modality in data.

# Multi-modality
real data are often multimodal.


# What is diffusion model?

## Mathematical explanation


## Development
DDPM, DDIM acceleration.

# Applications
## text to image model


## image to image


## inpainting

## diffusion policy
Diffusion policy is first proposed in [].
It solves the problem of original imition learning which can not handle multimodal data.
