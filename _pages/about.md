I am a phd student at Georgia Tech with research interest in optimal control of hybrid systems, reinforcement learning, and robotics. I am also deeply passionate about teaching, working on some personal projects and writing blogs. I hope to apply what I learned to solve real-world problems and make a positive impact in communities.
